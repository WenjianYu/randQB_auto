The source codes are transfered to THU-numbda (https://github.com/THU-numbda/randQB_auto).

Randomized QB factorization for fixed-precision low-rank matrix approximation.

This package includes Matlab codes for the randQB_EI and randQB_FP algorithms.
They are efficient randomized algorithms for the fixed-precision low-rank matrix 
approximation. The test cases and scripts for running the experiments in paper
"Efficient randomized algorithms for the fixed-precision low-rank matrix approximation" 
by Wenjian Yu, Yu Gu and Yaohang Li, are also included.
